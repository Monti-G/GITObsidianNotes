## Summary:

Computer programs consist of instructions executing one at a time.  Programs often use *variables* to refer to data, like x, y, and z.  Basic programs receive input, process input, and produce output.
## Key Concepts

| Term       | Definition                                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Program    | A series of instructions executed one at a time.                                                                            |
| Input      | Data from a file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.                                                                      |
| Process    | Tasks in a program that preforms computations on data, such as adding two values.                                           |
| Output     | The data a program puts somewhere after instructions are executed, such as a file, screen, or network.                      |
| Variables  | Data like x, y, and z.                                                                                                      |
| Code       | The textual representation of a program, AKA programming.                                                                   |
| Line       | A *line* in this context is a row of text, often code.                                                                      |
| Statement  | A program instruction, often appearing on its own line.                                                                     |
| Expression | Expressions are code that return a value when evaluated i.e x * y.                                                          |
| Assignment | Process of creating a new variable using the = symbol (i.e z = x + y makes a new variable z)                                |
| Comments   | Optional parts of programs not read by the machine meant to explain portions of code to other human readers.                |
| Whitespace | Any space, tab, or newline is called whitespace.                                                                            |
| Type       | A type determines how a value can behave.  For example, integers can be divided by 2 but not strings such as `"hello" / 2`. |
