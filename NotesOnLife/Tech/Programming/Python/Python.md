## Summary:

Known for it's simplicity, readability, and versatility, the dynamic high-level programming language Python is widely supported and utilized in almost everything from robotics to data science to scripting.  It was designed by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991.
## Key Concepts

For concepts more universal to programming as a whole please refer to [[Programming basics]].

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interpreter       | A Python interpreter is a program that executes code written in Python.  An *interactive* interpreter is a program, often displaying a prompt, allowing the user to execute one line of code at a time.  Interpreter mostly is used to load and execute files code is written into. |
| Prompt            | An indicator often seen in interactive interpreters indicating the interpreter is ready to accept code.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Newline character | Output can be moved to the next line using a *newline character* "/n".  `print('1\n2')` outputs 1 on the first line and 2 on the second.                                                                                                                                            |
| Escape sequence   | An *escape sequence* is a string that has a special meaning like the newline character "\n" that always starts with a backslash "\something".  \t inserts a tab, two backslashes prints an actual backslash character.                                                              |


## Functions


| Function | Use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input()  | Used to read input from a user.  Ex: `best_friend = input()` will read text entered by the user, and assign the result as a new string to the best_friend variable.  The function causes the program to wait until the user has entered text and pushed the return key. |
