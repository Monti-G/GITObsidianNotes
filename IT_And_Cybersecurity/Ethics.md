# Summary:

The practical work of *ethics* is not about applying the rules of morality to social, corporate, or institutionalized subject matter in order to yield specific results.  Nor is ethical thinking solely or even primarily about applying self-interpreting rules and laws to concrete situations in life.  Even within *deontology*—an ethical framework that is known to emphasize laws and rules—things are never this easy. Human life is much more complex, and the task of ethics is for each of us to live the best life that we can.  That task is complicated and challenging enough that most people decide, after some reflection, that they will take all the help they can get.

# The Why

Research by the Ethics Resource Center (ERC) found that 86 percent of the employees in companies with a well-implemented ethics and compliance program are likely to perceive a strong ethical culture within the company, while less than 25 percent of employees in companies with little to no program are likely to perceive a culture that promotes integrity in the workplace. A well-implemented ethics and compliance program and a strong ethical culture can, in turn, lead to less pressure on employees to misbehave and a decrease in observed misconduct. It also creates an environment in which employees are more comfortable reporting instances of misconduct, partly because there is less fear of potential retaliation by management against reporters (for example, reduced hours, transfer to less desirable jobs, and delays in promotions).

Regardless of industry or field ethics is important as it helps us address the questions of right and wrong we may run into during our careers and the conflicts such questions can pose with smooth business operations.  Framing your decisions with ethical frameworks can help people you're explaining them to understand your point of view on the matter.

# Frameworks:

### Deontology:

*Deontology* as an approach to ethics is best characterized by its focus on duties, rights, and moral obligations.  Its two main presuppositions are that ethical evaluation primarily concerns the rightness or wrongness of actions and that ethical reasoning should help determine what we ought to do. 

The word “deontology” comes from the Greek word *deon*, meaning duty, obligation, or “that which is binding,” and -ology, indicating a particular branch of knowledge.  Deontology has existed in various forms. One of the most famous is associated with the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant’s moral philosophy has been so influential that people sometimes refer to “Kantianism” as though it is its own ethical theory, similar to—although distinct from—deontology.

#### Common Misunderstandings:

Many people associate with ethics, this complex and nuanced framework is frequently misunderstood in three specific ways.  The first misunderstanding is that deontology is simple: you figure out what the law is, and then you do what it tells you to do or avoid doing what it does not permit you to do.  For many people, this is what ethics is all about: adhering to basic rules and laws.  But the demands of duty are complex, and balancing those many demands requires careful reflection, not just blind adherence. 
 

The second misunderstanding is that because it is difficult to honor one’s many duties at the same time, you can therefore pick and choose which laws to follow as a matter of individual choice or preference (or perhaps a matter of avoiding the least desirable punishments).  But simply acting on preferences and regarding those preferences as if they are binding laws is not an accurate description of deontology.  In fact, this kind of picking and choosing has more in common with moral relativism than it does with any of the ethical frameworks that we discuss in this chapter.  A moral relativist is someone who believes that all moral judgments are based on individual viewpoints and that no one viewpoint ought to be privileged above any other—save that person’s own, because most moral relativists are critical of anyone who disagrees with their position on the matter (Midgley 1991). 
 

The third misunderstanding is that because deontology considers intention to be important, it therefore does not consider consequences to be important at all.  The problem with this description of deontology is that it presents only a partial picture.  It may help us understand the points of emphasis within a deontological framework, but it is a characterization that obscures deontology’s many specificities and variations.  Most forms of deontology acknowledge the ethical significance of the consequences and context of moral actions and choices (Rawls 1999, especially p. 26), even though they emphasize principles, laws, rules, and obligations that guide human action and decision making.  Where these duties and moral obligations come from, and how they relate to each other, depend on the form or style of the deontology in question. 
 

Unlike the simplistic and piecemeal approaches described above, deontology offers an approach to ethics that is morally practicable without abandoning the seriousness of moral laws.  Deontology presumes that moral obligations are a real part of human life and cannot be dispensed with because they are inconvenient, even while it recognizes that honoring all of one’s moral obligations is rarely a straightforward task.  For a deontologist, the task of ethics is not to choose which obligations to follow but rather to consider all one’s moral obligations in order to determine how to live and to act in light of all of them, especially in situations that put (or seem to put) these obligations in tension with one another. 

#### Authority and Traditions:

In order to highlight the variation within deontology as a framework for thinking about ethics, below we introduce three different traditions that are deontological in their orientation. Each of them appeals to a particular kind of authority to justify and legitimate moral obligations and duties. The first tradition appeals to a “social contract,” and therefore the authority of the law is grounded in a political claim about what it means to live together in a society under reasonable principles that can be applied to all. The next tradition grounds the authority of moral obligations and constraints on the existence of a god or gods, to whom duty is owed and who determine human beings’ duties to others. Finally, we consider a tradition of deontology that insists that the basic principles of morality are to be derived from human reason. The feature that unifies all three of these traditions and warrants, describing them as deontological, is not a particular authority, duty, or even rule-governed action but is rather the belief that there is a difference between right and wrong and that this difference is supported by an authoritative claim about how we ought to act toward others and, in some cases, toward ourselves. 
 
It is important to note that these traditions are not mutually exclusive.

##### Political

Political authority comes from an organized human society. There are many forms of political authority, which vary with political systems. Authority is distinct from power, which in this context means the ability to materially enforce rules and punishment, irrespective of legitimacy. Most political systems and leaders claim to operate from a position of legitimate authority, serving the interests of the people, even if in practice they operate from a position of power.

##### Divine

Divine authority is authority from God or gods. If a set of laws is understood to have been given or revealed by a divine figure, then those laws gain their legitimacy from the existence and power of that God or gods. Different religious traditions have different ideas about how humans gain knowledge of these laws. In some traditions, these laws are said to be contained in holy books or sacred writings. In other cases, divine law is considered to be received through prophecy or through authoritative leaders. The ethical weight of an action might also be interpreted as gaining its authority from a God or gods without necessarily using the language of law.

##### Human Reason

The notion that human beings have an inherent moral compass that allows them to discern the difference between right and wrong is an ancient idea that became especially popular during the European intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment.  Over the centuries, theologians and philosophers have linked this belief in the human’s inherent capacity to judge between right and wrong to religious dispositions and creation stories.  In the book of Genesis, for example, the first humans are said to know the difference between right and wrong.  Thomas Aquinas, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argued that the very first principle of practical reasoning (i.e., ethical reflection on human action) is quite simple: avoid evil and do the good (Aquinas Summa Theologica I–II, 94, 2; see Aquinas 1948).  Aquinas insisted that all human beings know this basic principle and therefore can discern the difference between right and wrong.  While Aquinas appealed to a divine authority to support this claim, he also linked this capacity to the human’s ability to grasp the laws that govern and order the universe (i.e., natural laws).

Natural law theory accepts that law can be considered and spoken of both as a sheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of reasons for action that can be and often are sound as reasons and therefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them.  This dual character of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan “Unjust laws are not laws.” (Finnis 2020) 

Natural law theorists do not hold that ethics is simply a matter of sensing the difference between right and wrong, nor do they claim that deciding what to do in particular situations is easy.

##### Kantian Deontology

The notion that the universe is ordered by laws that can be apprehended by human reason was an especially popular belief in the eighteenth century, when Immanuel Kant was developing his philosophy. Kant’s moral philosophy is similar to Aquinas’s in that Kant believed that human beings are able to discern the difference between right and wrong. However, Kant was also writing at a time when people were becoming increasingly critical of claims that depended on religious authority, whether in the context of politics, of science, or of morality. And therefore Kant, as many other enlightenment thinkers, rejected the idea that any code of law handed down in a religious tradition or promulgated by the state can successfully address the full breadth and complexity of right and wrong.

True freedom, Kant maintained, is the freedom to act according to a law that you can both apply to yourself and universally legislate for all. A law such as this is what Kant calls a categorical imperative, by which he means a law that is unconditionally and universally valid. His first formulation of this law is as follows: 

`Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law. (Kant 1996, 73)

His second formulation of the categorical imperative reads: 

`Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means. (Kant 1996, 80) 

##### Modalities:

It is rarely possible to satisfy every single duty, or to satisfy them equally well, because circumstances often create tensions between our various duties.  This is largely because regardless of their authority, deontology grounds its rules and laws in relationships.

When balancing competing duties, a deontologist must consider the following two concerns:
 
###### How Fundamental Is It? 
 
Which duty is most fundamental? Of the many duties competing for your attention and action, which ones are the most important to who you are and your role in the world?  In a situation that compels a person to choose between protecting a stranger and protecting their child, nearly every deontologist would argue that it’s right and appropriate to protect the child, not because the agent has no duties at all to the stranger but because parents have particular duties toward their children. 
###### How Relevant Is It? 
 
Which duty is most relevant to the situation in question?  When you are making a decision about a specific situation, it is often the case that some of your many duties are more pressing than others because of the particular circumstances.  Imagine a soldier in a combat situation whose platoon-mate is injured in pursuit of the enemy.  Should this soldier stop and assist her injured comrade, or complete the mission and kill the enemy?  Both of these duties are important, but which is more relevant?  The answer will depend on a number of very specific factors: how badly injured is her comrade?  Is anyone else available to help him?  How likely is it that there will be another chance to kill this enemy?






### Virtue Ethics:

Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of human flourishing and human excellence. Its basic assumption is that all human beings share some basic qualities of character, though we vary widely in how much we excel at those qualities and how we express them, and each of us gets better (or worse) at them according to our experiences. It further assumes that human beings are concerned with how to live the good life and that ethics is a subset of what it means to live a full and happy life. 

Unlike deontology and other approaches to ethics, where the focus is primarily on actions and intentions, virtue ethics focuses on the whole person: the qualities of character that they have and the patterns of living that issue from and reveal those qualities. That pattern of being is called a habitus. By cultivating excellence in a range of basic human capacities, called the virtues, a person likewise builds their capacity for a fulfilling life, because exercising these virtues is what enables them to live in alignment with their goals and desires (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). For this reason, it is virtuous people who live happy and fulfilling lives (that is, who flourish): not because they are rewarded or deemed worthy by some external judge but because the practice of virtue helps them build and sustain a satisfying and rewarding life. 

Nobody is born virtuous. In fact, it’s not really possible to be virtuous until you are an adult, or at least old enough to maintain the practice of virtue from your own habitus, rather than because some external force like a parent or teacher imposes it on you (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). This does not mean that we are born vicious. Rather, virtue is developed over time, by emulating exemplary people and by cultivating good habits (Vallor 2016).

Virtues are the basic building blocks of human character; they are fundamental qualities like kindness, playfulness, or self-respect. Virtues are not qualities that only some people possess; rather, a virtue is the capacity to exercise that quality. According to virtue ethics, every person is endowed with the same basic library of virtues, and the potential to excel in any of these virtues is part of our basic makeup. Therefore, what differentiates us from one another is not whether or not we possess a given virtue, but rather the degree to which we have developed (or our parents and teachers have developed in us) the ability to exercise that virtue. Within a virtue ethics framework, a chronic liar would be understood as being very deficient in honesty rather than lacking honesty entirely. Given the right conditions and a genuine desire on that person’s part to become more honest, they could over time develop a greater capacity for honesty. 

### Communitarianism

Communitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around self-realization in the context of interdependence. Its basic assumption is that human beings exist in a state of mutual reliance on one another (Masolo 2010; Smith-Morris 2020). Although this interdependence includes material goods like shelter and safety, the more significant dimension of our interdependence concerns the many social, spiritual, and psychological goods that can only come from relationships with others. Because we are interdependent, everybody benefits from investing in the common good, or the well-being of the community as a whole (Masolo 2010; Wiredu 1992a).

Instead of conceiving of communities as collections of individuals who have decided to make common cause, communitarianism posits that communities exist prior to any individual born and raised within them (Menkiti 1984). By furnishing the language, values and relationships that form the basis of an individual’s experience, a community is necessarily foundational to understanding the character, goals, and potential of any individual within it. Furthermore, because of our interdependence, that individual’s self-realization—that is, the fulfillment of the individual’s potential and aims for themself—can take place only in a community setting, because relationships with others are essential to the structure and development of the self and because they create the context that makes an individual’s aims significant (Gyekye 1997, Masolo 2010).

### Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of happiness. Like virtue ethics, utilitarianism is an outcome-based approach to ethics that assumes that human beings are motivated by the desire to be happy. Building on the basic assumption that humans are motivated by happiness, utilitarians argue that when it comes to determining how we should act, we should first and foremost consider what kinds of actions bring about the most happiness for the greatest number of people. This is known as the principle of utility or the greatest happiness principle. 

Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, which is a category of ethical theories that focuses primarily or solely on consequences in determining the moral worth of an action. (Virtue ethics is also technically consequentialist because it is focused on outcomes, though its focus on character means it is not often categorized that way.) However, the choice to focus on consequences still leaves open a major question: whose consequences should be considered? Should we strive to create positive outcomes for everyone, or just for a chosen few? Different forms of consequentialism answer this question differently. According to ethical egoism, each person should prioritize their own well-being over others’. According to ethical altruism, each person should improve others’ well-being without regard to their own. In contrast to both of these, utilitarianism requires that everyone’s well-being counts equally; as such, the individual ought to reason about their own happiness in the same way that they ought to reason about the well-being of others.

### Responsibility Ethics

Responsibility ethics is an approach that developed in religious ethics in the wake of the Holocaust, the systematic murder of nearly 11 million people by the Third Reich (primarily Jews, but also Catholics, LGBTQ people, Romani, and political dissidents of all stripes) during World War II. In the years after the war, Christian and Jewish thinkers alike concluded that new approaches were needed to reckon with the previously unthinkable scope and scale of that event. They observed that such efficient, bureaucratized slaughter was possible only because of recent technological developments, which made both the transportation and killing more efficient and which enabled both soldiers and civil servants to play a role in the killings without having to confront their own actions directly. A few decades later, German Jewish philosopher Hans Jonas turned the core insights of responsibility ethics toward the issue of environmental degradation, arguing that humankind’s reckless exploitation and destruction of the natural world was similarly both life-threatening and morally disastrous (Jonas 1984).

Responsibility ethics contends that the major Western approaches to ethics—deontology, virtue ethics and utilitarianism—are not sufficiently attuned to how large, complex, and interdependent the world is. These other approaches, according to responsibility ethics, understand cause and effect in a narrow and limited way. In some cases, the limitation is about focusing only on one’s community or one’s immediate environment; in other cases, it’s about focusing on a specific sphere of concern (such as economics or health) and excluding other interrelated spheres from consideration. But either kind of limitation necessarily simplifies the problems we perceive. And when our formulation of a problem is too simple and too narrow, it is impossible to act in a truly responsible way. 
 
Because of the complexity of the systems we inhabit, we rarely know the full scope of our actions. In this way, responsibility ethics offers a particularly sharp critique of utilitarianism—not because its aims are bad but because the idea that we could meaningfully anticipate the outcomes of our actions is, according to its premises, both naive and unrealistic. 

The framework of responsibility ethics could, in principle, be useful at any moment in history. But its concerns are made more urgent by recent developments in technology, both by increasing our ability to act and by making it even harder for us to perceive or understand the scope of the impact that our actions have. Technologies of all kinds extend our ability to act in the world, whether by protecting our bodies, making it easier for us to accomplish certain tasks, or amplifying the effects of the actions we take.

### Feminist Ethics

The structures that shape our world were, by and large, imagined and implemented by the people who already had leisure, resources, and social power. As a result, the voices and perspectives of the least powerful and cared-for in society have largely been excluded from how they were created and applied. Though all the frameworks described above all seek to protect (and even elevate) those less powerful members of society, their notions of how to accomplish this are still mostly limited to how powerful people think about it; the perspectives and insights of the less powerful themselves are largely excluded. This limitation, critics argue, makes these frameworks insufficient to combat “the pattern, widespread across cultures and history, that distributes power asymmetrically to favor men over women, creating and maintaining social institutions and practices that systematically put men’s interests and preoccupations ahead of women’s” (Lindemann 2019, 10). 
 
Feminist ethics is an approach to ethics that aims to repair the ramifications of this long-term exclusion by focusing on the lives, experiences, and concerns of women and other disempowered persons. It frequently centers emotional ties and empathy, not only as goods in themselves but also as sources (often unacknowledged by traditional Western ethics) for our reasoning about others (Gilligan 1993; Held 2014). Rather than offering a single unified theory of ethics, feminist ethics offers “a way of doing ethics” (Lindemann 2019) shaped by “the needs of those one cares for in relational contexts” rather than by “abstract, universal principles” (Norlock 2019). 

In focusing on societal patterns of power and disempowerment, feminist ethics seeks to correct for imbalances that it perceives in the traditional Western frameworks. These imbalances include focusing on isolated autonomous actors, at the expense of recognizing our interdependence and the constraints that shape our choices (Jaggar 1992; Lindemann 2019); emphasizing public issues at the expense of private ones (Noddings 1984); and treating abstract versions of a given problem as more real than specific instances (McLaren 2011). This focus on the public and the abstract, feminist ethicists contend, works to obscure the realm of private and interpersonal experience and by extension trivializes any insights or modes of reasoning that emerge from taking that realm seriously (Jaggar 1992; McLaren 2011; Noddings 1984).

Because of its attention to care relationships in the context of systemic power imbalances, feminist ethics is especially useful for understanding how different forms of systemic oppressions interact and reinforce one another. Although early feminist ethics tended to focus solely on women’s disempowerment, later waves have expanded to encompass LGBTQIA+ people, Black and indigenous people of color, and other minoritized communities as within their sphere of concern.

### The Capability Approach

Capability is an approach to ethics that was derived and adapted from a broader normative framework used across many fields. It aims to create the conditions for people to fulfill their potential, not by celebrating freedom in the abstract but by paying attention to the practical conditions of people’s lives—the actual freedoms, resources and opportunities that are available to them. Accordingly, it evaluates both individual actions and broader social policies in terms of how they support people’s capabilities and thus their functionings: that is, the resources that they draw on (capabilities) in order to do and to be in the ways that matter to them (functionings). 
 

The Capability Approach (CA) was first introduced by the economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s, in response to trends in political theory and the international policy that (Sen argued) were narrowly focused on economic growth at the expense of human well-being. All forms of this versatile framework are rooted in a political vision of real, feasible human freedom, in which people have the opportunities to live and act in ways that they themselves value. CA has been developed as an ethical framework by the philosopher Martha Nussbaum and others, but it is frequently used in economics and political science and has been especially influential in the field of international development (Torrente and Gould 2018, 596). 
 

Like utilitarianism, CA is consequentialist and pragmatic, and it relies on factual, empirical data. But unlike utilitarianism, CA is concerned primarily with creating the potential for good outcomes. This focus on potentiality means that it is able to take seriously an individual’s actions, their ability to choose, the importance of their own individual goals and preferences, and the circumstances that shape and constrain their lives. Rather than focusing primarily on individual agents acting in pursuit of the good, CA focuses on the development and organization of society. And rather than insisting on the possibility of free action localized in the human individual, it emphasizes the conditions that make it possible to expand the capacities for action itself. Instead of simply valuing freedom in the abstract sense, CA examines people’s real opportunities to do and be what they have reason to value. 
 

Capabilities are the resources that individuals have. Those resources include material goods such as money or property, shelter, and food, but they also include intangibles like health and access to education, transportation, and other intangible resources. Although Sen did not think there is or should be a list of core capabilities, Nussbaum’s adaptation of CA has proposed a list of what she calls basic capabilities, which emphasizes human dignity (Nussbaum 1997; Sen 2005). The 10 basic capabilities are being able to live a normal lifespan; having good health; maintaining bodily integrity; being able to use the senses, imagination, and thought; having emotions and emotional attachments; possessing practical reason to form a conception of the good; having social affiliations that are meaningful and respectful; expressing concern for other species; being able to play; and having control over one’s material and political environment (see Nussbaum 2000, 33, paraphrased from Jacobs 2020). Furthermore, Nussbaum explicitly stresses the importance of both the internal and external conditions, distinguishing between internal capabilities and combined capabilities.

# Normative vs Descriptive:

Ethical statements typically come in two varieties: *normative* and *descriptive*.  In a normative statement one provides an assessment of how things should be rather than how they are: for example, “he was wrong to do that” or “being kind is more important than being the most successful.”  Normative statements are rooted in value judgments about what is good and what is bad, or what is permissible and what is forbidden, or they are assessments of the relative value of different things.  Ethics is often (mis)understood to be only normative: that is, to be aimed at establishing norms of thought, values, or conduct.

While description is an essential part of ethics, it is vital to recognize that making a judgment always necessarily involves norms.  Although it is the normative element that often makes ethical judgments recognizable, the process that is used to arrive at ethical judgments is often described in a way that erases the norms themselves.  When this erasure has happened, ethics appear to be simply a matter of knowing the relevant facts, and it can seem as if normative assessments follow automatically from an accounting of those facts.  But a person who reasons in this way is not being objective, even though they may feel like they are.  They are simply overlooking the foundations of their own observations and logic.

The difference between descriptive and normative may seem clear in theory, but in practice, the distinction gets fuzzier the closer you look. Which facts are the most important in a given situation? How do we describe them? How do we fill in the gaps between the facts we have? These are all questions about how to describe a given situation, but any one of them could affect the ethical judgment you or others make in the end.  Every person has their own ideas about what is ethical and what is not, including you. Those ideas are shaped by the culture around us, but they are also specific to each of us.
