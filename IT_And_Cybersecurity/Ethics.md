# Summary:

The practical work of *ethics* is not about applying the rules of morality to social, corporate, or institutionalized subject matter in order to yield specific results.  Nor is ethical thinking solely or even primarily about applying self-interpreting rules and laws to concrete situations in life.  Even within *deontology*—an ethical framework that is known to emphasize laws and rules—things are never this easy. Human life is much more complex, and the task of ethics is for each of us to live the best life that we can.  That task is complicated and challenging enough that most people decide, after some reflection, that they will take all the help they can get.


## Frameworks:

### Deontology:

*Deontology* as an approach to ethics is best characterized by its focus on duties, rights, and moral obligations.  Its two main presuppositions are that ethical evaluation primarily concerns the rightness or wrongness of actions and that ethical reasoning should help determine what we ought to do. 

The word “deontology” comes from the Greek word *deon*, meaning duty, obligation, or “that which is binding,” and -ology, indicating a particular branch of knowledge.  Deontology has existed in various forms. One of the most famous is associated with the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Kant’s moral philosophy has been so influential that people sometimes refer to “Kantianism” as though it is its own ethical theory, similar to—although distinct from—deontology.

#### Common Misunderstandings:

Many people associate with ethics, this complex and nuanced framework is frequently misunderstood in three specific ways.  The first misunderstanding is that deontology is simple: you figure out what the law is, and then you do what it tells you to do or avoid doing what it does not permit you to do.  For many people, this is what ethics is all about: adhering to basic rules and laws.  But the demands of duty are complex, and balancing those many demands requires careful reflection, not just blind adherence. 
 

The second misunderstanding is that because it is difficult to honor one’s many duties at the same time, you can therefore pick and choose which laws to follow as a matter of individual choice or preference (or perhaps a matter of avoiding the least desirable punishments).  But simply acting on preferences and regarding those preferences as if they are binding laws is not an accurate description of deontology.  In fact, this kind of picking and choosing has more in common with moral relativism than it does with any of the ethical frameworks that we discuss in this chapter.  A moral relativist is someone who believes that all moral judgments are based on individual viewpoints and that no one viewpoint ought to be privileged above any other—save that person’s own, because most moral relativists are critical of anyone who disagrees with their position on the matter (Midgley 1991). 
 

The third misunderstanding is that because deontology considers intention to be important, it therefore does not consider consequences to be important at all.  The problem with this description of deontology is that it presents only a partial picture.  It may help us understand the points of emphasis within a deontological framework, but it is a characterization that obscures deontology’s many specificities and variations.  Most forms of deontology acknowledge the ethical significance of the consequences and context of moral actions and choices (Rawls 1999, especially p. 26), even though they emphasize principles, laws, rules, and obligations that guide human action and decision making.  Where these duties and moral obligations come from, and how they relate to each other, depend on the form or style of the deontology in question. 
 

Unlike the simplistic and piecemeal approaches described above, deontology offers an approach to ethics that is morally practicable without abandoning the seriousness of moral laws.  Deontology presumes that moral obligations are a real part of human life and cannot be dispensed with because they are inconvenient, even while it recognizes that honoring all of one’s moral obligations is rarely a straightforward task.  For a deontologist, the task of ethics is not to choose which obligations to follow but rather to consider all one’s moral obligations in order to determine how to live and to act in light of all of them, especially in situations that put (or seem to put) these obligations in tension with one another. 

#### Authority and Traditions:

In order to highlight the variation within deontology as a framework for thinking about ethics, below we introduce three different traditions that are deontological in their orientation. Each of them appeals to a particular kind of authority to justify and legitimate moral obligations and duties. The first tradition appeals to a “social contract,” and therefore the authority of the law is grounded in a political claim about what it means to live together in a society under reasonable principles that can be applied to all. The next tradition grounds the authority of moral obligations and constraints on the existence of a god or gods, to whom duty is owed and who determine human beings’ duties to others. Finally, we consider a tradition of deontology that insists that the basic principles of morality are to be derived from human reason. The feature that unifies all three of these traditions and warrants, describing them as deontological, is not a particular authority, duty, or even rule-governed action but is rather the belief that there is a difference between right and wrong and that this difference is supported by an authoritative claim about how we ought to act toward others and, in some cases, toward ourselves. 
 
It is important to note that these traditions are not mutually exclusive.

##### Political

Political authority comes from an organized human society. There are many forms of political authority, which vary with political systems. Authority is distinct from power, which in this context means the ability to materially enforce rules and punishment, irrespective of legitimacy. Most political systems and leaders claim to operate from a position of legitimate authority, serving the interests of the people, even if in practice they operate from a position of power.

##### Divine

Divine authority is authority from God or gods. If a set of laws is understood to have been given or revealed by a divine figure, then those laws gain their legitimacy from the existence and power of that God or gods. Different religious traditions have different ideas about how humans gain knowledge of these laws. In some traditions, these laws are said to be contained in holy books or sacred writings. In other cases, divine law is considered to be received through prophecy or through authoritative leaders. The ethical weight of an action might also be interpreted as gaining its authority from a God or gods without necessarily using the language of law.

##### Human Reason

The notion that human beings have an inherent moral compass that allows them to discern the difference between right and wrong is an ancient idea that became especially popular during the European intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment.  Over the centuries, theologians and philosophers have linked this belief in the human’s inherent capacity to judge between right and wrong to religious dispositions and creation stories.  In the book of Genesis, for example, the first humans are said to know the difference between right and wrong.  Thomas Aquinas, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argued that the very first principle of practical reasoning (i.e., ethical reflection on human action) is quite simple: avoid evil and do the good (Aquinas Summa Theologica I–II, 94, 2; see Aquinas 1948).  Aquinas insisted that all human beings know this basic principle and therefore can discern the difference between right and wrong.  While Aquinas appealed to a divine authority to support this claim, he also linked this capacity to the human’s ability to grasp the laws that govern and order the universe (i.e., natural laws).

Natural law theory accepts that law can be considered and spoken of both as a sheer social fact of power and practice, and as a set of reasons for action that can be and often are sound as reasons and therefore normative for reasonable people addressed by them.  This dual character of positive law is presupposed by the well-known slogan “Unjust laws are not laws.” (Finnis 2020) 

Natural law theorists do not hold that ethics is simply a matter of sensing the difference between right and wrong, nor do they claim that deciding what to do in particular situations is easy.

##### Kantian Deontology

The notion that the universe is ordered by laws that can be apprehended by human reason was an especially popular belief in the eighteenth century, when Immanuel Kant was developing his philosophy. Kant’s moral philosophy is similar to Aquinas’s in that Kant believed that human beings are able to discern the difference between right and wrong. However, Kant was also writing at a time when people were becoming increasingly critical of claims that depended on religious authority, whether in the context of politics, of science, or of morality. And therefore Kant, as many other enlightenment thinkers, rejected the idea that any code of law handed down in a religious tradition or promulgated by the state can successfully address the full breadth and complexity of right and wrong.

True freedom, Kant maintained, is the freedom to act according to a law that you can both apply to yourself and universally legislate for all. A law such as this is what Kant calls a categorical imperative, by which he means a law that is unconditionally and universally valid. His first formulation of this law is as follows: 

`Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law. (Kant 1996, 73)

His second formulation of the categorical imperative reads: 

`Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means. (Kant 1996, 80) 

##### Modalities:

It is rarely possible to satisfy every single duty, or to satisfy them equally well, because circumstances often create tensions between our various duties.  This is largely because regardless of their authority, deontology grounds its rules and laws in relationships.

When balancing competing duties, a deontologist must consider the following two concerns:
 
###### How Fundamental Is It? 
 
Which duty is most fundamental? Of the many duties competing for your attention and action, which ones are the most important to who you are and your role in the world?  In a situation that compels a person to choose between protecting a stranger and protecting their child, nearly every deontologist would argue that it’s right and appropriate to protect the child, not because the agent has no duties at all to the stranger but because parents have particular duties toward their children. 
###### How Relevant Is It? 
 
Which duty is most relevant to the situation in question?  When you are making a decision about a specific situation, it is often the case that some of your many duties are more pressing than others because of the particular circumstances.  Imagine a soldier in a combat situation whose platoon-mate is injured in pursuit of the enemy.  Should this soldier stop and assist her injured comrade, or complete the mission and kill the enemy?  Both of these duties are important, but which is more relevant?  The answer will depend on a number of very specific factors: how badly injured is her comrade?  Is anyone else available to help him?  How likely is it that there will be another chance to kill this enemy?






### Virtue Ethics:

Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics organized around the idea of human flourishing and human excellence. Its basic assumption is that all human beings share some basic qualities of character, though we vary widely in how much we excel at those qualities and how we express them, and each of us gets better (or worse) at them according to our experiences. It further assumes that human beings are concerned with how to live the good life and that ethics is a subset of what it means to live a full and happy life. 

Unlike deontology and other approaches to ethics, where the focus is primarily on actions and intentions, virtue ethics focuses on the whole person: the qualities of character that they have and the patterns of living that issue from and reveal those qualities. That pattern of being is called a habitus. By cultivating excellence in a range of basic human capacities, called the virtues, a person likewise builds their capacity for a fulfilling life, because exercising these virtues is what enables them to live in alignment with their goals and desires (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). For this reason, it is virtuous people who live happy and fulfilling lives (that is, who flourish): not because they are rewarded or deemed worthy by some external judge but because the practice of virtue helps them build and sustain a satisfying and rewarding life. 

Nobody is born virtuous. In fact, it’s not really possible to be virtuous until you are an adult, or at least old enough to maintain the practice of virtue from your own habitus, rather than because some external force like a parent or teacher imposes it on you (Hursthouse and Pettigrove 2016). This does not mean that we are born vicious. Rather, virtue is developed over time, by emulating exemplary people and by cultivating good habits (Vallor 2016).

Virtues are the basic building blocks of human character; they are fundamental qualities like kindness, playfulness, or self-respect. Virtues are not qualities that only some people possess; rather, a virtue is the capacity to exercise that quality. According to virtue ethics, every person is endowed with the same basic library of virtues, and the potential to excel in any of these virtues is part of our basic makeup. Therefore, what differentiates us from one another is not whether or not we possess a given virtue, but rather the degree to which we have developed (or our parents and teachers have developed in us) the ability to exercise that virtue. Within a virtue ethics framework, a chronic liar would be understood as being very deficient in honesty rather than lacking honesty entirely. Given the right conditions and a genuine desire on that person’s part to become more honest, they could over time develop a greater capacity for honesty. 

### Normative vs Descriptive:

Ethical statements typically come in two varieties: *normative* and *descriptive*.  In a normative statement one provides an assessment of how things should be rather than how they are: for example, “he was wrong to do that” or “being kind is more important than being the most successful.”  Normative statements are rooted in value judgments about what is good and what is bad, or what is permissible and what is forbidden, or they are assessments of the relative value of different things.  Ethics is often (mis)understood to be only normative: that is, to be aimed at establishing norms of thought, values, or conduct.

While description is an essential part of ethics, it is vital to recognize that making a judgment always necessarily involves norms.  Although it is the normative element that often makes ethical judgments recognizable, the process that is used to arrive at ethical judgments is often described in a way that erases the norms themselves.  When this erasure has happened, ethics appear to be simply a matter of knowing the relevant facts, and it can seem as if normative assessments follow automatically from an accounting of those facts.  But a person who reasons in this way is not being objective, even though they may feel like they are.  They are simply overlooking the foundations of their own observations and logic.

The difference between descriptive and normative may seem clear in theory, but in practice, the distinction gets fuzzier the closer you look. Which facts are the most important in a given situation? How do we describe them? How do we fill in the gaps between the facts we have? These are all questions about how to describe a given situation, but any one of them could affect the ethical judgment you or others make in the end.  Every person has their own ideas about what is ethical and what is not, including you. Those ideas are shaped by the culture around us, but they are also specific to each of us.
